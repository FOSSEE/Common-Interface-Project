Task 1: React

Make an output page containing charts each having data.

Connect to https://xcosblocks.fossee.org/api/instructions/get to start
receiving events looking like this:

=========================================================================
event: instruction
data: addChart id=1 type=bar xMin=0 xMax=10 yMin=-30 yMax=30

event: instruction
data: addChart id=2 type=curve xMin=0 xMax=20 yMin=-10 yMax=10

event: instruction
data: addData id=1 x=2 y=6

event: instruction
data: addData id=2 x=3 y=1

event: instruction
data: reset

event: instruction
data: addChart id=1 type=curve xMin=0 xMax=10 yMin=-30 yMax=30

event: done
data: none

=========================================================================

Note that there may be a delay between two successive events. Order of events is
important. You have to receive and process one event at a time.

Depending on the events received, take the following actions:

1. event: instruction

The instruction event will be of three types of data. Depending on the data
received, take the following actions:

                                                             # Comments
data: addChart id=uniqueId type=chartType other-parameters   # add (render) a chart to the page
data: addData id=chartId other-parameters                    # add (render) a point to that chart
data: reset                                                  # clear the page. remove all added charts

Once the event is completed, wait for the next event.

2. event: done

Ignore the data. Close the connection.

Endpoint: /api/instructions/get

GET / POST parameters: (none)

Output: An eventstream which gives a series of instructions

Example of output:

Add 1st chart (as before)

|        Chart 1        |          # Add first chart of full width

Add 2nd chart in same row

|  Chart 1  |  Chart 2  |          # Each chart will be 50% of page width

When 3th chart is to be added, change to 2-row layout.

|  Chart 1  |  Chart 2  |          #
|        Chart 3        |          # Add third chart of full width on 2nd row

|  Chart 1  |  Chart 2  |          #
|  Chart 3  |  Chart 4  |          # Each chart will be 50% of page width

When 5th chart is to be added, change to 3-row layout.

|  Chart 1  |  Chart 2  |          #
|  Chart 3  |  Chart 4  |          #
|        Chart 5        |          # Add fifth chart of full width on 3nd row

2.

Add error logging. Errors can be of the following types:

Unsupported event

Unsupported instruction (for instruction event)

For addChart instruction:

id is missing or empty
id is duplicate (since last reset)
type is missing or empty
type is unsupported
mandatory parameter (based on type) is missing

For addData instruction:

id is missing or empty
id does not exist
mandatory parameter (based on type) is missing

Note: the error event must be logged and ignored. Processing of the next event
must continue.
